# CS 224 Spring 2019 - Programming Assignment 3

For this assignment, we wrote a Python program to simulate an elevator system. For distributing passengers onto their destination floors in a predetermined movement algorithm for the elevator

## Running the program

```
python otis.py mine fast
```
* (mine) is an optional command-line argument -- When present this turns on the algorithm featuring my unique solution in optimizing the passenger to floor movement determinism.
* (fast) is an optional command-line argument -- When present this optional argument invokes the debug off notation so the print out runs the entire algorithm through to the end and then give you move count and time statistics without having to sit through the entire operation of the algorithm through building output.
